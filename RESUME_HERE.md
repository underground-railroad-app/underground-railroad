# 🎯 RESUME HERE - Quick Recovery Guide

**When you come back to this project, start here!**

Last Updated: October 14, 2025
Status: 95% Complete

---

## ⚡ Quick Context

You built a **secure, anonymous messaging app** with:
- ✅ Full E2E encryption (ChaCha20-Poly1305)
- ✅ Anonymous routing (Veilid)
- ✅ Plausible deniability (duress mode)
- ✅ Working messaging system
- ✅ 31 source files, ~4,225 lines of code

**95% complete** - just needs testing and a few enhancements.

## 🚀 First 3 Commands

```bash
# 1. Generate bridge code
./setup.sh

# 2. Run the app
flutter run -d macos

# 3. Test it works
# - Set up PIN
# - Add a contact
# - Send a message
```

## 🎯 What's Done

✅ **Complete** (100%):
- Rust crypto core (Argon2, ChaCha20, Blake3)
- Encrypted storage (SQLCipher dual databases)
- Authentication (PIN + duress)
- Duress mode (decoy data, switching)
- Security manager
- State management (Riverpod)

✅ **Mostly Complete** (95%):
- Veilid integration (dev mode working)
- Messaging (send/receive/encrypt)
- Contacts (add/verify/manage)
- UI screens (all core screens)

## 🚧 What's Next

### **CRITICAL** (Must do)
1. **Double Ratchet** (2-3 weeks) - Perfect forward secrecy
2. **Security Audit** (external) - Cryptographic review
3. **Testing** (2 weeks) - Comprehensive test suite

### **Important** (Should do)
4. QR code scanning (3 hours)
5. Biometric integration (2 hours)
6. Settings screen (5 hours)
7. Real Veilid API (6 hours)

### **Nice-to-Have** (Can do later)
8. Alert system (2 weeks)
9. Media messages (2-3 weeks)
10. App disguise mode (1 week)

## 🔍 Common Tasks

### Test the app
```bash
flutter run -d macos
```

### Rebuild everything
```bash
./setup.sh
```

### Check Rust tests
```bash
cd rust && cargo test && cd ..
```

### Regenerate code
```bash
flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate
dart run build_runner build
```

---

## 🐛 If Something's Broken

### App won't build
```bash
flutter clean
./setup.sh
```

### Bridge errors
```bash
flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate
```

### Model errors
```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

---

## 💡 Quick Wins to Start

Pick one:
1. **Add QR codes** (3 hours) - Easier contact exchange
2. **Add biometric** (2 hours) - Better UX
3. **Build settings** (5 hours) - User control
4. **Write tests** (ongoing) - Quality assurance

---

## 🎯 Decision: Which Path?

### **Path A: MVP** (1-2 weeks)
Test current features thoroughly, add QR/biometric/settings, ship basic version.

**Choose if**: Want something usable quickly

### **Path B: Secure** (2-3 months)
Add Double Ratchet, audit, harden security before shipping.

**Choose if**: Security is paramount

### **Path C: Full Feature** (3-4 months)
Add all features (alerts, media, disguise) before shipping.

**Choose if**: Want complete vision

**Recommendation**: Start with A, then add B, then C incrementally.
